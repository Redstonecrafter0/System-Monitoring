# New Release v{{ VERSION }}

This is a new version of my System-Monitoring program.

To use it, it is recommended to use at least Java 11.

The full documentation is available on the [README](https://github.com/Redstonecrafter0/System-Monitoring/blob/master/README.md) of the master branch.

### Chrome Extension
In case you also want to display data from [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com) you have to also download the ChromeExtension.zip from the latest release.  
After that you unzip that file to a folder where it can be.  
To install that to Chrome you type the url `chrome://extensions` in Chrome.  
Next you click on the top left button that says `Load unpacked` and select the folder where you extracted the zip file before and the `manifest.json` is inside.  
I didn't find a way to disable that annoying logging of the broken connection on the dev console of Chrome on YouTube Music so don't wonder.
